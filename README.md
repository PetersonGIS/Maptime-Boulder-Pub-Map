# Maptime Boulder: Pub Map

![EndResult](https://github.com/PetersonGIS/Maptime-Boulder-Pub-Map/blob/master/images/FinalMapSmall.jpg)

This is a tutorial for making a historic pub map with QGIS using data from Geofabrik (OpenStreetMap), UK Data Service, Ordnance Survey, and a historic pubs point dataset created for this tutorial. This tutorial is also available as a [live demo presentation, presented at FOSS4GNA 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCFbMPP_1xQ). 

## Download and install QGIS

This tutorial requires QGIS 2.8.x. Download and install from [QGIS.org](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). If you have a previous version of QGIS already installed, it is ok to have both versions installed as they are stored in folders according to their release number.

## Add the tutorial data to QGIS

Open QGIS Desktop. Download the three datasets from the data folder locally and add them to your qgis project by dragging the .shp files to the layer list. These files are buildings, dlua_regions, and wards. Also download the historic pubs data from its [repository](https://github.com/PetersonGIS/GeoJSON-HistoricPubs) and add it (.geojson file) to the QGIS project as well by dragging it to the layer list.
